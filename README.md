# Cottontrust
Hello world! This is COTTONTRUST's main repository, made especifically for the publishing of our article [(link do artigo)] on the 38th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA-2024). 

We're glad to make this repository public and allow others to replicate the results of our research. Despite the AINA2023 branch being locked, the development of the project continues as our research progresses.
