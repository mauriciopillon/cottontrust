# Cottontrust
Hello world! This is COTTONTRUST's main repository and we're glad to share it to the public and allow others to replicate the results of our research. Despite the AINA2023 branch being locked, the development of the project continues as our research progresses.

The technology that lies under our project is powered by Hyperledger Indy and the Von Network environment provided by them for our PoC.
