Overviews

The cotton production chain is conceptualized as an interconnected network of nodes, with each phase represented by entities participating in the chain. The entities involved include seed producers, farms, cotton processing units, traders, international and national markets, certifying bodies, and cotton classifiers. Each entity plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and transparency of the cotton production chain.

Architecture

COTTONTRUST utilizes the SSI model, with each entity represented by a Decentralized Identifier (DID) registered on the Hyperledger Indy blockchain. The architecture incorporates components such as decentralized identifiers, digital agents, verifiable data registries, and verifiable credentials. These components enable entities to interact securely, exchange credentials, and verify information without the need for intermediaries.

Components

    Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Unique identifiers assigned to each entity on the blockchain, ensuring digital uniqueness and enabling secure interactions.
    Digital Agents and Wallets: Entities maintain digital wallets to store credentials, DIDs, and private keys. Digital agents facilitate interactions with the ecosystem.
    Verifiable Data Registry (RDV): Serves as an immutable record of DIDs, schemas, and public keys, supporting the validation of verifiable presentations.
    Verifiable Credentials: Entities accumulate verifiable credentials containing relevant data such as certification seals, compliance reports, and quality assessments. These credentials establish trust and transparency within the chain.

Functioning

The operational dynamics involve entities establishing connections, requesting or receiving verifiable credentials, and validating information as needed. This process ensures that entities can prove specific facts or aspects of their identity securely. The functionality of COTTONTRUST is depicted in a trust triangle, emphasizing the reliance on decentralized trust relationships facilitated by the blockchain.

Example Scenario: Obtaining and Verifying Certification

An example scenario illustrates the process of obtaining the 'SouABR' sustainability certification from ABRAPA and subsequently verifying its authenticity by the buyer. This process highlights the secure exchange of verifiable credentials and the verification of presented information, ensuring trust and reliability in the certification process.
